# NBA-2pt-vs-3pt
NBA Three Points Evolution Trend analysis based on multiple factors (independent variables) with linear-regression model using Python (Pandas and Matplotlib).

We wanted to look at the evolutionary trend within the NBA, specifically how the use of the 3pt. has changed through the years since it's been implemented. Players used to attempt to score closer to the basketball rim In order to ensure higher accuracy, but itâ€™s been confirmed by sports analysts that players are attempting and making more 3pt. through the years and the league has been in talks of creating a 4pt perimeter on the basketball court. 

Our Questions

1.	How have team attempts and percentages changed throughout the decades?
2.	What is the relationship between the 3pt. and a championship caliber team?
3.	How have player roles changed through the years due to the 3pt?
